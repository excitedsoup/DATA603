## Nosql: [A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-nosql-database-management-systems-and-models)

A NoSQL database is an alternative to an SQL database. In recent years, as the data we have access to has become less structured on average, they've become more popular, due 
to their ability to handle semi-structured and unstructured data better than traditional SQL databases. The types of operational models listed were:

* Key-Value Store
* Columnar Database
* Document Store
* Graph Database

Each has particular applications that justify their use over SQL, as well as each other. I found the idea of a columnar database interesting, as it flips the way you have to
think about the data that's stored.

## Data Lakes: [What is a Data Lake?](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lake)

A Data Lake is method of storing vast amounts of data that can be transformed into something queryable when it is needed (as seen below). To build something queryable, data is
given multiple metadata tags when it is put into the data lake, and thus can be sorted appropriately when it comes time to do so. With our increased capacity for scalable storage,
a data lake takes full advantage of that capability. The article does mention the need to maintain the data, as with bad practices, the data lake can turn into a "data swamp",
meaning it has little to no use.
