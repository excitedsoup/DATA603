## Hello, this is Peter Kirk's Data 603 final project

The goal of the project was to use D.C. weather and crash data from 2014-2019 to make a model that predicts crashes based on:
* AWND - Average wind speed
* PRCP - Precipitation
* SNWD - Snow Depth
* SNOW - Snowfall
* TAVG - Average temperature
as well as the year, month, and day.

### Data

Contains data I started with, as well as the combined data that I used - combined.csv

### Presentations

Contains each iteration on presentations I created. 'Presentation_ Traffic and Weather Conditions in D.C. 603.pdf' and 'Presentation_ Traffic and Weather Conditions in D.C. 603.pptx' are the final presentations.

### Base directory

Contains my code in pdf and ipynb format. Combiner.ipynb combines the crash data and weather data into combined.csv. WeatherCleaner.ipynb cleans the weather data (or does it clean the weather?)

To run, place combined.csv in your working directory, and run the code.
