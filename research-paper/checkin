In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, different countries took different steps to prevent the spread of covid. Specifically, the US used lockdowns and travel
restrictions, while South Korea went a little further - they used contact tracing. As per (one of my links), South Korea was extremely effective at reducing the spread of covid
in comparison, despite their population geography being more challenging. Their population per square mile is SIGNIFICANTLY higher, and their capitol, Seoul, is more population
dense than New York City. Despite this, using a contact tracing approach (using big data), they were able to achieve significantly better results than most countries
(coming in at #'number here' in the world) in terms of lowest infections, among other statistics.

Cover the approach the U.S. took citing articles/sources to give detail

Cover the approach South Korea used, and how it incorporated big data (their phones would alert that they had been in contact with someone and to quaratine, additionally it would
give some data as to how/when they came into contact). Comment on masks in asian culture.

Compare approaches, comment on cultural differences (masks) and how people perceived the disease.
