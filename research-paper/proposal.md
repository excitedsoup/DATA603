# Proposal

For my paper, I'd like to look at the way contact tracing influenced how we, as a whole, handled the spread of covid. 
I'd like to look at how different countries implemented it in regards to the technology as well as method of data gathering, 
and how those factors affected the results they achieved in preventing spread.

I'm not sure if I need to write more/do more, but I can't think of anything else to add to that.
