# Contact Tracing During Covid-19 in South Korea vs Methods Used by the United States
In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, different countries took different steps to prevent the spread of covid. Specifically, the US used lockdowns and travel restrictions, while South Korea went a little further - they used contact tracing. South Korea was extremely effective at reducing the spread of covid in comparison, despite their population geography being more challenging. Their population per square mile is SIGNIFICANTLY higher, and their capitol, Seoul, is more population dense than New York City. Despite this, using a contact tracing approach (using big data), they were able to achieve significantly better results than most countries. By the end of 2020 they came in at 61769 cases with a population of 51.78 million in terms of lowest infections (.12% infection rate), while the US had 20.16 million with a population of 329.5 million (6.11% infection rate).

To achieve such results, South Korea used contact tracing. Max Kim met with Song In-su, the deputy of public relations in South Korea to determine how they did this. To start, when a case is found, "[they] strip the information of any identifying markers before posting it on the district office’s Web site, blog, and social-media accounts; [they] also sends out emergency text alerts," (Kim) wheras the U.S "erred on the side of individual privacy" (Kim). The U.S. has always been a place where individual rights and lower levels of government involvement have been more popular, but South Korea attempts to remedy possible fears by being "a larger regime of transparency" (Kim). Their CDC "deliver[s] detailed reports in measured tones", "shar[es] the routes of confirmed patients", "distribut[es] infection and testing data to journalists with remarkable frequency" and sends "Emergency text alerts about significant developments... to every smartphone in the nation" (Kim). As a result, Kim says "Such openness has been rewarded by an abiding trust in the government’s containment protocols. Panic has been minimal; toilet paper is in abundant supply". Later, Kim is shown the website that tracks cases and additional data about those cases. "The entries, each appended with a detailed list of the stops the patient had made, in sparse, sterile language, read like a ship’s logbook. '08:00 left home (on foot) / mask worn...'". To send text alerts, they used a "remote broadcasting apparatus" to send a message out to every phone in a 5 km radius. Additionally, at community health centers run covid testing sites, where "results are usually delivered within twenty-four hours, by text message" (Kim). However, behind the scenes, the 

> team retraces their movements based on their oral testimony, and then combs through relevant C.C.T.V. footage in order to locate others who might have been exposed... Say there’s someone who was within two metres of the patient at a restaurant, but we don’t know who that person is, except what they look like in the C.C.T.V. footage... we ask the credit-card company to pull up that customer’s information and ask them to tell them to contact us. That person is then put under monitored self-isolation for two weeks, using an app that tracks his phone to insure that [they aren't] breaking quarantine.

Kim then talked to a law professor, that said

>The United States was quick to ban businesses, while countries like France instituted lockdowns. But South Korea hasn’t been able to do the same because we’re very cautious about these kinds of measures, in the same way that other countries are cautious about privacy... few countries were getting away with not sacrificing some kinds of freedom. As Kim pointed out, the true question was which freedoms to prioritize... sacrificing some individual privacy was simply the upfront cost of avoiding more debilitating consequences down the line.

To combat concerns from the public about government scrutiny, South Korea has made a case for what Kim calls "virtuous surveillance—a radically transparent version of people-tracking that is subject to public scrutiny and paired with stringent legal safeguards against abuse". Their results, shown previously, speak for themselves. While their method didn't exactly involve big data specifically, if expanded to areas with a more serious in-progress infection, or even the world, the number of entries would be moving into the millions, rather than the the tens of thousands they saw, while tracking their individual routes to alert those they may have been in contact with.

By comparison, the U.S. declared a public health emergency on February 3rd, a national emergency on March 13th alongisde a travel ban from Europe (AJMC) - and not much else, leaving the rest of lockdown measures up to the states. By June 26th, the White House Coronavirus Task Force meets to discuss "the rate of positive test results [being] on the rise in some states..." (AJMC), notably overlapping with those that are beginning to re-open. Given the extreme geographical differences favoring the U.S. over South Korea, it seems that a similar system could have been implemented to assist in preventing the U.S. from being the country with the most cases, as well as most cases per capita.
