# Contact Tracing During Covid-19 in South Korea vs Methods Used by the United States
In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, different countries took different steps to prevent the spread of covid. Specifically, the US used lockdowns and travel restrictions, while South Korea went a little further - they used contact tracing. South Korea was extremely effective at reducing the spread of covid in comparison, despite their population geography being more challenging. Their population per square mile is SIGNIFICANTLY higher, and their capitol, Seoul, is more population dense than New York City. Despite this, using a contact tracing approach (using big data), they were able to achieve significantly better results than most countries. By the end of 2020 they came in at 61769 cases with a population of 51.78 million in terms of lowest infections (.12% infection rate), while the US had 20.16 million with a population of 329.5 million (6.11% infection rate).
