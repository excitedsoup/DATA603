# Contact Tracing During Covid-19 in South Korea vs Methods Used by the United States
In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, different countries took different steps to prevent the spread of covid. Specifically, the US used lockdowns and travel restrictions, while South Korea went a little further - they used contact tracing. South Korea was extremely effective at reducing the spread of covid in comparison, despite their population geography being more challenging. Their population per square mile is SIGNIFICANTLY higher, and their capitol, Seoul, is more population dense than New York City. Despite this, using a contact tracing approach (using big data), they were able to achieve significantly better results than most countries. By the end of 2020 they came in at 61769 cases with a population of 51.78 million in terms of lowest infections (.12% infection rate), while the US had 20.16 million with a population of 329.5 million (6.11% infection rate).

To achieve such results, South Korea used contact tracing. Max Kim met with Song In-su, the deputy of public relations in South Korea to determine how they did this. To start, when a case is found, "[they] strip the information of any identifying markers before posting it on the district office’s Web site, blog, and social-media accounts; [they] also sends out emergency text alerts," (Kim) wheras the U.S "erred on the side of individual privacy" (Kim). The U.S. has always been a place where individual rights and lower levels of government involvement have been more popular, but South Korea attempts to remedy possible fears by being "a larger regime of transparency" (Kim). Their CDC "deliver[s] detailed reports in measured tones", "shar[es] the routes of confirmed patients", "distribut[es] infection and testing data to journalists with remarkable frequency" and sends "Emergency text alerts about significant developments... to every smartphone in the nation" (Kim). As a result, Kim says "Such openness has been rewarded by an abiding trust in the government’s containment protocols. Panic has been minimal; toilet paper is in abundant supply". Later, Kim is shown the website that tracks cases and additional data about those cases. "The entries, each appended with a detailed list of the stops the patient had made, in sparse, sterile language, read like a ship’s logbook. '08:00 left home (on foot) / mask worn...'". To send text alerts, they used a "remote broadcasting apparatus" to send a message out to every phone in a 5 km radius. Additionally, at community health centers run covid testing sites, where "results are usually delivered within twenty-four hours, by text message" (Kim). However, behind the scenes, the 

> team retraces their movements based on their oral testimony, and then combs through relevant C.C.T.V. footage in order to locate others who might have been exposed... Say there’s someone who was within two metres of the patient at a restaurant, but we don’t know who that person is, except what they look like in the C.C.T.V. footage... we ask the credit-card company to pull up that customer’s information and ask them to tell them to contact us. That person is then put under monitored self-isolation for two weeks, using an app that tracks his phone to insure that [they aren't] breaking quarantine.

Kim then talked to a law professor, that said

>The United States was quick to ban businesses, while countries like France instituted lockdowns. But South Korea hasn’t been able to do the same because we’re very cautious about these kinds of measures, in the same way that other countries are cautious about privacy... few countries were getting away with not sacrificing some kinds of freedom. As Kim pointed out, the true question was which freedoms to prioritize... sacrificing some individual privacy was simply the upfront cost of avoiding more debilitating consequences down the line.

To combat concerns from the public about government scrutiny, South Korea has made a case for what Kim calls "virtuous surveillance—a radically transparent version of people-tracking that is subject to public scrutiny and paired with stringent legal safeguards against abuse". Their results, shown previously, speak for themselves. To solidify the case that it was, at least in large part due to contact tracing, there have been studies performed, such as "Contact Tracing during Coronavirus Disease Outbreak, South Korea, 2020" which detail positive findings:

>We analyzed reports for 59,073 contacts of 5,706 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) index patients reported in South Korea during January 20–March 27, 2020. Of 10,592 household contacts, 11.8% had COVID-19. Of 48,481 nonhousehold contacts, 1.9% had COVID-19. **Use of personal protective measures and social distancing reduces the likelihood of transmission.**

## Shows occurence of reduction in cases

While South Korea's method didn't exactly involve big data specifically, if expanded to areas with a more serious in-progress infection, or even the world, the number of entries would be moving into the millions, rather than the the tens of thousands they saw, while tracking their individual routes to alert those they may have been in contact with.

By comparison, the U.S. declared a public health emergency on February 3rd, a national emergency on March 13th alongisde a travel ban from Europe (AJMC) - and not much else, leaving the rest of lockdown measures up to the states. By June 26th, the White House Coronavirus Task Force meets to discuss "the rate of positive test results [being] on the rise in some states..." (AJMC), notably overlapping with those that are beginning to re-open. Given the extreme geographical differences favoring the U.S. over South Korea, it seems that a similar system could have been implemented to assist in preventing the U.S. from being the country with the most cases, as well as most cases per capita.

However, there is another, possibly glaring, issue to consider. Public perception of Covid-19 in the U.S. differed wildly from the perception in South Korea. Specifically, a study has been done on "Negative attitudes about facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic: The dual importance of perceived ineffectiveness and psychological reactance", citing "2,078 adults from the US and Canada" having a 16% rate of being against anti-mask. Conversely, the team handling contact tracing in South Korea had to deal with an opposite problem; people publically judging others for not being cautious *enough*, "On a popular local Facebook group, someone had written a post denouncing her for being so irresponsible. 'Just die alone, why would you cause other people harm,' one member said. Another remarked that the patient should have been hit with a giant hospital bill..." (Kim). This can at least be partially seen in a cultural difference of mask wearing, as historian Emma Teng says:

>In East Asia, face masks are worn for a wide range of purposes. Combating urban pollution is a top reason for many, but it’s also common to wear a face mask to prevent allergies, for extra sun protection, or even because you want to run down to the corner shop anonymously and it’s too early to face your neighbors.
>Masks can sometimes provide a little extra privacy in densely populated East Asian cities — on the subway or train, for example. In cold and flu season, many consider it prudent to wear a face mask and carry disposable hand wipes to fight contagion. And if you have a cold yourself, you are expected as a matter of basic etiquette to wear a face mask out in public, in the office, and at school in order to protect others from possible infection.

Mask wearing in East Asia has been popular for at least a century, which could be part of why it was so easily accepted there. However, Tang also says "the use of masks as a public health measure in East Asia seems to have arisen with the 1918 influenza pandemic..." (Teng), which makes it seem plausible that this could be the start of a similar culture developing more widely around the world. A change of public perception such as that could easily expand people's minds to be accepting of large amounts of government involvement in the form of contact tracing to greatly reduce the impact of the next large pandemic.

Overall, the South Korean response to Covid-19 was incredibly effective when compared to the approach the U.S. took, and while some level of freedom was maintained by the U.S, it remains a question what good freedom from government intervention is when nature reigns that freedom in through disease. The data seems to suggest that the U.S, or even a more worldwide, big data approach to contact tracing could allow us as a species to more effectively combat future pandemics, using a more unified, effective method.
